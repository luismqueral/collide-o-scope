# voice and tone

write like you're labeling a tape. lowercase. say less. explain the why, not the what. if it sounds like documentation, rewrite it until it doesn't.

## principles

- **lowercase everything** — titles, headings, comments, commit messages, changelogs. no shouting, no title case. the only exception is acronyms (FFmpeg, ML, API).
- **talk like a colleague** — imagine you're explaining something to someone sitting next to you in the studio. no corporate voice, no "please note that", no "it should be noted".
- **say less** — if you can cut a word, cut it. if a sentence works without an adjective, drop the adjective. brevity is the whole aesthetic.
- **explain the why** — comments should say *why* something exists, not *what* it does. the code already says what. "# loop short clips to fill the output duration" not "# this loops the clips".
- **use dashes** — kebab-case for files, dashes in prose where commas would feel heavy. fragments are fine. full sentences optional.
- **no emoji** — unless the user explicitly asks for them. the work is serious even when the tone isn't.
- **plain english** — no jargon unless it's domain-specific (colorkey, ffprobe, chroma key are fine. "leverage", "utilize", "facilitate" are not).

## in code comments

comments can be more verbose than docs — this is where you explain the thinking, the tradeoffs, the "here's what I tried and why this won." multi-line is fine, even encouraged when the logic is non-obvious. just keep the tone human.

```python
# BAD
# This function retrieves the video duration by calling ffprobe
# and parsing the output to extract the duration value.

# GOOD
# asks ffprobe how long this video is, returns seconds.
# we shell out instead of using a python lib because ffprobe
# handles edge cases (variable frame rate, missing headers)
# better than anything else.

# BAD
# Set the similarity parameter for the colorkey filter
"similarity": [0.2, 0.4],

# GOOD
# how close a pixel must be to the key color to become transparent
# lower = stricter (less transparency), higher = looser (more transparency)
# [min, max] → randomized per run for variety
"similarity": [0.2, 0.4],
```

## in docs and changelogs

```markdown
# BAD
## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture
and design decisions made during the development of the project.

# GOOD
# collide-o-scope architecture
how the pieces fit together and why they're shaped that way.

# BAD
- Updated the multi-layer rendering pipeline to incorporate embedded
  metadata generation functionality utilizing the cryptic text generator module.

# GOOD
- wired metadata generator into the render pipeline — each video now
  gets a title and description baked into the MP4 container
```

## in generated text (titles, descriptions)

the metadata generator already follows this, but the rule is: it should feel found, not authored. like a label on a tape in a box in a room no one's been in for a while.

## when in doubt

read it out loud. if it sounds like a README template, a corporate wiki, or a textbook — rewrite it. it should sound like a person who's been working on this for a while and is writing notes to themselves.
