# tools

standalone utilities that don't fit the script pattern. things you run once or occasionally, not as part of the synthesis pipeline.

## what's here

- **camera-search.html** — opens in a browser. generates youtube search URLs for common camera file naming patterns (DCIM, IMG, MOV, CAM, etc.) to help find raw, low-view footage for scraping.

## what will go here

- **batch-render.py** — run N synthesis sessions back to back
- **youtube-bulk-schedule.py** — scan a directory of MP4s, read embedded metadata, upload and schedule to YouTube
